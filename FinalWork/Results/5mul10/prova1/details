Starting code
Read a word from memory, multiply it by 10, then store it back into the memory.
Repeated 5 times, last store in memory is not executed because the processor returns.

uGP parameters
Starting population = 10
Individuals per population = 30
Lambda = 10
Generations to stop when stale = 10
Max generations = 300
Max time = 12000 s

codeShuffler parameters
Do-nothing probability = 70%
NOP probability = 10%
Swap probability = 10%
Substitute probability = 10%


Result and termination.
Stopped at iteration 27 because genes became stale after 10 generations.
