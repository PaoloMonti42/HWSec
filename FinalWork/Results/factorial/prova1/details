Starting population = 100 (lower populations had difficulty in finding many individuals with fitness != 0) 
Individuals per population = 50
Lambda = 25
Generations to stop when stale = 20
Max generations = 1000
Max time = none

Do-nothing probability = 75%
NOP probability = 10%
Swap probability = 5%
Substitute probability = 10%


Result and termination.
Stopped at iteration 118 because genes were stale after 20 generations.
