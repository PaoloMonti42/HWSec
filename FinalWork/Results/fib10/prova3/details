Starting code
Read the first two words from memory. Use them as the starting point for the Fibonacci sequence and generate the next 8


uGP parameters
Starting population = 50 (lower populations had difficulty in finding many individuals with fitness != 0) 
Individuals per population = 50
Lambda = 25
Generations to stop when stale = 20
Max generations = 300
Max time = 12000 s

codeShuffler parameters
Do-nothing probability = 75%
NOP probability = 10%
Swap probability = 5%
Substitute probability = 10%


Result and termination.
Stopped at iteration 106 because genes became stale after 20 generations.
