Starting code
Computes the product of two 2x2 matrices and stores the result in the ram

uGP parameters
Starting population = 100 (lower populations had difficulty in finding many individuals with fitness != 0) 
Individuals per population = 100
Lambda = 25
Generations to stop when stale = 20
Max generations = 1000
Max time = none

codeShuffler parameters
Do-nothing probability = 75%
NOP probability = 10%
Swap probability = 5%
Substitute probability = 10%


Result and termination.
Stopped at iteration 305 because genes became stale after 20 generations.
