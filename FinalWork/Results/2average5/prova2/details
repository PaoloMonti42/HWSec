Starting population = 50 (lower populations had difficulty in finding many individuals with fitness != 0) 
Individuals per population = 30
Lambda = 30
Generations to stop when stale = 20
Max generations = 300
Max time = 12000 s

codeShuffler parameters
Do-nothing probability = 75%
NOP probability = 10%
Swap probability = 5%
Substitute probability = 10%


Result and termination.
Stopped at iteration 52 because genes became stale after 20 generations.
